This project aims to provide an in-depth analysis and interactive visualizations of the content available on major streaming platforms: Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and Prime Video. Through dynamic charts, users can explore the geographical distribution of content, identify trends in genres and age ratings, and compare the evolution of the libraries across different platforms.

The data used for this project comes from various public sources available on the platforms' libraries. It includes detailed information such as genres, countries of origin, production years, and content classifications.  

This project implements visualization techniques to transform complex data into easily understandable insights. It is accessible via this [link](https://ismailchakrane.github.io/StreamViz/).

## Key Questions  

The project addresses the following questions:  
- How is content distributed by country of origin?  
- Which genres dominate on each streaming platform?  
- How has the quantity of content evolved over the years?  
- What is the distribution of movies and TV shows on each platform?  
- What major differences can be observed between Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and Prime Video?  
- How do age ratings vary by genre or platform?  

## Main Visualizations  

1. **Global Comparison of Streaming Platforms**  
   This section provides a comparative analysis of the content catalogs of major streaming platforms, focusing on key metrics such as genre distribution, age classifications, and temporal trends. Interactive filters allow users to refine their exploration by year, continent, or content type.  

2. **Content Quantity by Year**  
   A chart illustrating the evolution of the number of contents added each year on different platforms, helping to identify trends in library expansion or contraction over time.  

3. **Movie Duration by Year (in Minutes)**  
   This visualization shows the average duration of movies added each year, offering insights into trends in movie length across platforms.  

4. **Number of Seasons by Year**  
   A graph showing the total number of TV show seasons added each year, allowing an analysis of the evolution of series production on the platforms.  

5. **Content Distribution by Genre**  
   A pie chart or bar chart illustrating the distribution of different content genres available on each platform, helping to understand the content preferences of each streaming service.  

6. **Content Distribution by Age Rating**  
   This visualization analyzes the distribution of age ratings (such as TV-G, TV-MA, PG, etc.) of the content on the platforms, offering insights into the types of audiences targeted by each service.  

7. **Geographical Content Map**  
   An interactive map representing the distribution of TV shows and movies by country.  

These interactive visualizations allow users to deeply explore the catalogs of major streaming platforms, providing valuable insights into the diversity and trends of the content offered.  

## Technologies Used
